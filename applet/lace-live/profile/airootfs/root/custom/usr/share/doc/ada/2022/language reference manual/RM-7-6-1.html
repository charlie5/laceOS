<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I4174"></A>For the <I>finalization</I> of 
a master, dependent tasks are first awaited, as explained in <A HREF="RM-9-3.html">9.3</A>. 
Then each object whose accessibility level is the same as that of the 
master is finalized if the object was successfully initialized and still 
exists. These actions are performed whether the master is left by reaching 
the last statement or via a transfer of control. When a transfer of control 
causes completion of an execution, each included master is finalized 
in order, from innermost outward.&nbsp;</div>

called earlier, either explicitly or as part of an assignment; hence, 
if a controlled type is visibly controlled (implying that its Finalize 
primitive is directly callable), or is nonlimited (implying that assignment 
is allowed), its Finalize procedure is ideally designed to have no ill 
effect if it is applied a second time to the same object.&nbsp;</div>
