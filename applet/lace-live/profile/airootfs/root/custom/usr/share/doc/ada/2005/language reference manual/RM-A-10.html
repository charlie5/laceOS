<H1>A.10 Text Input-Output</H1>

<H4 Class="centered">Static Semantics</H4>
<DIV Class="paranum">1</DIV>
<DIV Class="Normal">This clause describes the package Text_IO, which 
provides facilities for input and output in human-readable form. Each 
file is read or written sequentially, as a sequence of characters grouped 
into lines, and as a sequence of lines grouped into pages. The specification 
of the package is given below in subclause <A HREF="RM-A-10-1.html">A.10.1</A>.</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">2</DIV>
<DIV Class="Normal">The facilities for file management given above, in 
subclauses <A HREF="RM-A-8-2.html">A.8.2</A> and <A HREF="RM-A-8-3.html">A.8.3</A>, 
are available for text input-output. In place of Read and Write, however, 
there are procedures Get and Put that input values of suitable types 
from text files, and output values to them. These values are provided 
to the Put procedures, and returned by the Get procedures, in a parameter 
Item. Several overloaded procedures of these names exist, for different 
types of Item. These Get procedures analyze the input sequences of characters 
based on lexical elements (see Section 2) and return the corresponding 
values; the Put procedures output the given values as appropriate lexical 
elements. Procedures Get and Put are also available that input and output 
individual characters treated as character values rather than as lexical 
elements. Related to character input are procedures to look ahead at 
the next character without reading it, and to read a character &ldquo;immediately&rdquo; 
without waiting for an end-of-line to signal availability.</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">3</DIV>
<DIV Class="Normal">In addition to the procedures Get and Put for numeric 
and enumeration types of Item that operate on text files, analogous procedures 
are provided that read from and write to a parameter of type String. 
These procedures perform the same analysis and composition of character 
sequences as their counterparts which have a file parameter.</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">4</DIV>
<DIV Class="Normal">For all Get and Put procedures that operate on text 
files, and for many other subprograms, there are forms with and without 
a file parameter. Each such Get procedure operates on an input file, 
and each such Put procedure operates on an output file. If no file is 
specified, a default input file or a default output file is used.</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">5</DIV>
<DIV Class="Normal"><A NAME="I5655"></A><A NAME="I5656"></A>At the beginning 
of program execution the default input and output files are the so-called 
standard input file and standard output file. These files are open, have 
respectively the current modes In_File and Out_File, and are associated 
with two implementation-defined external files. Procedures are provided 
to change the current default input file and the current default output 
file.&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">6</DIV>
<DIV Class="Normal"><A NAME="I5657"></A>At the beginning of program execution 
a default file for program-dependent error-related text output is the 
so-called standard error file. This file is open, has the current mode 
Out_File, and is associated with an implementation-defined external file. 
A procedure is provided to change the current default error file.</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">7</DIV>
<DIV Class="Normal"><A NAME="I5658"></A><A NAME="I5659"></A><A NAME="I5660"></A>From 
a logical point of view, a text file is a sequence of pages, a page is 
a sequence of lines, and a line is a sequence of characters; the end 
of a line is marked by a <I>line terminator</I>; the end of a page is 
marked by the combination of a line terminator immediately followed by 
a <I>page terminator</I>; and the end of a file is marked by the combination 
of a line terminator immediately followed by a page terminator and then 
a <I>file terminator</I>. Terminators are generated during output; either 
by calls of procedures provided expressly for that purpose; or implicitly 
as part of other operations, for example, when a bounded line length, 
a bounded page length, or both, have been specified for a file.</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">8</DIV>
<DIV Class="Normal">The actual nature of terminators is not defined by 
the language and hence depends on the implementation. Although terminators 
are recognized or generated by certain of the procedures that follow, 
they are not necessarily implemented as characters or as sequences of 
characters. Whether they are characters (and if so which ones) in any 
particular implementation need not concern a user who neither explicitly 
outputs nor explicitly inputs control characters. The effect of input 
(Get) or output (Put) of control characters (other than horizontal tabulation) 
is not specified by the language. <A NAME="I5661"></A></DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">9</DIV>
<DIV Class="Normal"><A NAME="I5662"></A><A NAME="I5663"></A><A NAME="I5664"></A><A NAME="I5665"></A>The 
characters of a line are numbered, starting from one; the number of a 
character is called its <I>column number</I>. For a line terminator, 
a column number is also defined: it is one more than the number of characters 
in the line. The lines of a page, and the pages of a file, are similarly 
numbered. The current column number is the column number of the next 
character or line terminator to be transferred. The current line number 
is the number of the current line. The current page number is the number 
of the current page. These numbers are values of the subtype Positive_Count 
of the type Count (by convention, the value zero of the type Count is 
used to indicate special conditions).&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">10</DIV>
<DIV Class="Examples" Style="margin-bottom: 0.9em"><B>type</B>&nbsp;Count&nbsp;<B>is</B>&nbsp;<B>range</B>&nbsp;0&nbsp;..&nbsp;<SPAN Class="roman"><I>implementation-defined</I></SPAN>;<BR>
<B>subtype</B>&nbsp;Positive_Count&nbsp;<B>is</B>&nbsp;Count&nbsp;<B>range</B>&nbsp;1&nbsp;..&nbsp;Count'Last;</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">11</DIV>
<DIV Class="Normal"><A NAME="I5666"></A><A NAME="I5667"></A>For an output 
file or an append file, a <I>maximum line length</I> can be specified 
and a <I>maximum page length</I> can be specified. If a value to be output 
cannot fit on the current line, for a specified maximum line length, 
then a new line is automatically started before the value is output; 
if, further, this new line cannot fit on the current page, for a specified 
maximum page length, then a new page is automatically started before 
the value is output. Functions are provided to determine the maximum 
line length and the maximum page length. When a file is opened with mode 
Out_File or Append_File, both values are zero: by convention, this means 
that the line lengths and page lengths are unbounded. (Consequently, 
output consists of a single line if the subprograms for explicit control 
of line and page structure are not used.) The constant Unbounded is provided 
for this purpose.&nbsp;</DIV>
