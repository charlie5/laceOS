<H1>8.2 Scope of Declarations</H1>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p1">1</a></div>
<div class="Normal">[For each declaration, the language rules define 
a certain portion of the program text called the <I>scope</I> of the 
declaration. The scope of a declaration is also called the scope of any 
view or entity declared by the declaration. Within the scope of an entity, 
and only there, there are places where it is legal to refer to the declared 
entity. These places are defined by the rules of visibility and overloading.]

<div class="paranum"><a name="p2">2</a></div>
<div class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em"><A NAME="I4640"></A>The 
<I>immediate scope</I> of a declaration is a portion of the declarative 
region immediately enclosing the declaration. The immediate scope starts 
at the beginning of the declaration, except in the case of an overloadable 
declaration, in which case the immediate scope starts just after the 
place where the profile of the callable entity is determined (which is 
at the end of the <SPAN Class="swiss">_specification</SPAN> for the callable 
entity, or at the end of the <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="AA-12-3.html#S0315">generic_instantiation</A></SPAN>

region, with the following exceptions:&nbsp;</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p2.a">2.a</a></div>
<div class="Annotations"><B>Reason:&nbsp;</B>The reason for making overloadable 
declarations with profiles special is to simplify compilation: until 
the compiler has determined the profile, it doesn't know which other 
declarations are homographs of this one, so it doesn't know which ones 
this one should hide. Without this rule, two passes over the <SPAN Class="swiss">_specification</SPAN> 
or <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="AA-12-3.html#S0315">generic_instantiation</A></SPAN> 
would be required to resolve names that denote things with the same name 
as this one.&nbsp;</div>

The notion of &quot;visible part&quot; has been extended in Ada 95. The 
syntax of task and protected units now allows private parts, thus requiring 
us to be able to talk about the visible part as well. It was necessary 
to extend the concept to subprograms and to generic units, in order for 
the visibility rules related to child library units to work properly. 
It was necessary to define the concept separately for generic formal 
packages, since their visible part is slightly different from that of 
a normal package. Extending the concept to composite types made the definition 
of scope slightly simpler. We define visible part for some things elsewhere, 
since it makes a big difference to the user for those things. For composite 
types and subprograms, however, the concept is used only in arcane visibility 
rules, so we localize it to this subclause.</div>
