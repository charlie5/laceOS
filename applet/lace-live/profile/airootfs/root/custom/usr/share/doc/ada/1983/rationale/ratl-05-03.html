<H2>CHAPTER 5: Numeric Types</H2>

<H3><a name="5.3">5.3 The Real Types</a></H3>

The real  types form two classes: floating point types and fixed point
types. Both  are approximate  and are different forms of approximation
to the  real numbers  of mathematics.  With floating  point types, the
error in  representing a mathematical value is roughly proportional to
its absolute  value over  a large range. In contrast, the error with a
fixed point  value has  an absolute bound, so that small values have a
correspondingly large relative error.
<p>
The real  type definition  specifies bounds  on the permitted error in
the representation of values: the precision for floating point and the
delta for fixed point. A floating point type declaration of the form
<p>
<PRE>    type T is digits D;</PRE>
<p>
specifies D  significant decimal  digits precision.  It would  perhaps
have been  more consistent  to specify  a bound  on the relative error
directly, but  giving the number of significant decimal digits is more
natural for  the user.  The use of a range constraint, in the extended
form of declaration
<p>
<PRE>    type T is digits D range L .. R;</PRE>
<p>
signifies the  construction of a subtype. The check that the values of
L and  R lie within the range of the base type is therefore a run-time
check, and CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised if it fails.
<p>
A fixed point type declaration of the form
<p>
<PRE>    type T is delta D range L .. R;</PRE>
<p>
specifies the  delta D,  which is  an absolute  bound on the permitted
error. Here  a bound  specified in  decimal  digits  would  have  been
inappropriate, and  too coarse, for a binary machine. In this case the
range constraint  is not optional since an unbounded range would imply
an infinite  number of  values;  the  declaration  is  illegal  if  no
predefined base type exists that accommodates the range and delta.
<p>
The predefined operations provided for floating and fixed types differ
in detail  in order  to reflect correctly the handling of error bounds
within a computation. The accuracy constraints determine parameters to
a semantic  model for  the real types which is used to bound errors on
the predefined operations. This is described below in <a href="#5.3.3">section 5.3.3</a>.
<p>
<H4>Attributes</H4>

Ada provides three classes of predefined attributes for real types:
<ol>
<li>those also  associated with  other scalar types (such
   as 'FIRST and 'LAST),
<p>
<li>those specific to the guaranteed properties of a real
   type (such as 'DIGITS), and
<p>
<li>those associated  with  machine-dependent  properties
   (such as 'MACHINE_RADIX).
</ol>

There are  several predefined attributes that apply to both classes of
real types.  For each  such type  R, R'FIRST  and R'LAST are values of
type R  that bound  all the  values of R. The integer value R'MANTISSA
gives the number of binary places for the mantissa (floating point) or
magnitude (fixed  point) in  the abstract representation for the type.
R'SMALL and  R'LARGE are  values  of  type  universal_real  which  are
respectively the  smallest positive  nonzero  value  and  the  largest
positive value in the abstract representation.

<H3><BR><a name="5.3.1">5.3.1 Floating Point Types</a></H3>

The following  operators are defined for the predefined floating point
type FLOAT:
<p>
<center><table border cellpadding=6><tr><th align=left>Operator</th><th align=left>Meaning</th><th align=left>Result Type</th></tr>
<tr><td>
<table><tr><td><pre>+  -

BOOLEAN</pre></td></tr></table></tr></table></center>

<p>
Both operands of the binary operators +, -, &#42;, / and of the relational
operators must  have the  same type.  If system-defined floating point
types such  as LONG_FLOAT  are implemented,  then overloadings  of the
arithmetic and  relational operators are defined for these types in an
analogous manner.
<p>
The operators  =  and  /=  could  have  been  excluded  because  their
semantics  is  of  doubtful  validity,  since  the  representation  is
approximate. Given a precision of 6 digits, then equality could either
mean equality  of representation  (which would  typically be of higher
precision) or  equality only to 6 digits. If the former semantics were
chosen then  equality would  be  implementation  dependent.  Moreover,
since some  implementations may  use a  higher precision for temporary
values than  for declared  objects, it  would be  possible  after  the
assignment
<p>
<PRE>    X :=  (Y + Z);</PRE>
<p>
to have
<p>
<PRE>    X /= (Y + Z)</PRE>
<p>
If the  latter semantics  were chosen, then equality would be computed
as approximately  equal. This  would lead to the anomaly that equality
would no longer be transitive, that is, it would be possible that
<p>
<PRE>    X = Y and Y = Z and X /= Z</PRE>
<p>
The decision  has been  to allow  equality since it is defined for all
other types.  The user must be aware that the implemented precision is
used,  that   is,  the  values  X  and  Y  are  equal  only  if  their
representations are identical, and that in consequence code may not be
portable. (The situation is no better with other languages.)
<p>
The exponentiation operation for floating point operands is defined by
repeated multiplication  in the  same way  as  with  integers.  For  a
negative exponent,  the value  is the reciprocal of the value with the
positive exponent. The exponent is of type INTEGER.
<p>
The  predefined   attribute  R'DIGITS   yields  the   value  (of  type
universal_integer) that  appears as the accuracy constraint that gives
the precision of the type or subtype R.
<p>
As explained  earlier, the  precision of  the predefined  types FLOAT,
LONG_FLOAT, and  so on, is defined by the implementation. The user may
define other floating point types directly in terms of their precision
and range, in which case an appropriate one of the predefined types is
selected by  the compiler  and the user-defined type is a subtype of a
type derived  from this  predefined type.  Alternatively, the user may
define types  derived  from  the  predefined  types  by  reducing  the
precision requirement and constraining the range. Thus in practice, at
the  machine  level,  there  will  be  only  one  or  two  implemented
precisions. As  for other  constraints, the  range constraints and the
precision reductions are checked by the compiler.
<p>
Defining floating point types directly in terms of their precision and
range is preferable for portability. In this case the types are mapped
on the nearest applicable machine implemented precision. As an example
consider the type declarations
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
type MY_SHORT_FLOAT is digits 6;
type MY_FLOAT       is digits 8;
type MY_LONG_FLOAT  is digits 10;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
On a machine for which the implemented precision provides 7 digits for
FLOAT and 14 for LONG_FLOAT these declarations have the same effect as
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
type MY_SHORT_FLOAT is new FLOAT digits 6;
type MY_FLOAT       is new LONG_FLOAT digits 8;
type MY_LONG_FLOAT  is new LONG_FLOAT digits 10;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
On another  machine, for  which the  implemented precisions  provide 8
digits for  FLOAT and  16 for  LONG_FLOAT, these declarations have the
same effect as
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
type MY_SHORT_FLOAT is new FLOAT digits 6;
type MY_FLOAT       is new FLOAT digits 8;
type MY_LONG_FLOAT  is new LONG_FLOAT digits 10;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
If a  range constraint  is included  in the  type declaration,  then a
check is  made that the range inherited from the implemented type will
cover the range specified. If the check fails then CONSTRAINT_ERROR is
raised.
<p>
To summarize,  the language provides a direct and simple mechanism for
achieving efficient  use of  the available  precisions predefined by a
given implementation.
<p>
<H4>Example:</H4>

As an illustration of the direct use of the predefined types FLOAT and
LONG_FLOAT, consider the following typical library function:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
function DOT_PRODUCT(X,Y :  FLOAT_VECTOR) return FLOAT is
  SUM :  LONG_FLOAT :=  0.0;
begin
  for I in X'RANGE loop
    SUM :=  SUM + LONG_FLOAT(X(I)) &#42; LONG_FLOAT(Y(I));
  end loop;
  return FLOAT (SUM);
end DOT_PRODUCT;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
If the machine has an instruction that forms the double length product
from two  single length  operands, it  is fairly simple for a peephole
optimizer to  use this  instruction in  the inner  loop  (rather  than
expand each operand and multiply).
<p>
<H4>Multiple precisions</H4>
<p>
If an  application requires  floating point  computation with multiple
precisions, then  two means  can be  used to  achieve this: the use of
subtypes, and the use of types.
<DL>
<DT><b>(1) Use of Subtypes</b>
<p>
<DD>To use  subtypes, a type must be declared with the largest required
   precision, for example
<p>
<PRE>    type MY_REAL is digits 20;</PRE>
<p>
   Then variables or subtypes can be declared:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
X :  MY_REAL;        -- digits 20
Y :  MY_REAL digits 15;
subtype SHORT_REAL is MY_REAL digits 10;
Z1, Z2, Z3 :  SHORT_REAL;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
   The operations  on MY_REAL  are defined for all variables with that
   base type  (X, Y,  Z1, Z2, Z3). Hence it is not possible to provide
   an overloaded  SQRT function  just for  SHORT_REAL. Similarly,  the
   error analysis is dependent on the operators for the type MY_REAL.
<p>
   An optimizing  compiler may  be able  to  use  single  length  data
   representation for each variable, but this depends on the variables
   being invisible  to other  compilation units  and on the ability of
   the compiler to establish that the semantics will be preserved.
<p>
   Note that  the declaration  of Y is also an implicit assertion that
   the precision  of MY_REAL  is at  least 15  digits. This  could  be
   useful for  defensive programming in large systems. For example, if
   in a  later revision  of the  program the  precision  of  the  type
   MY_REAL is  reduced by  more than  5, then the compiler will give a
   warning message  upon recompilation  of the declaration of Y (or at
   least cause CONSTRAINT_ERROR to be raised).
<p>
<DT><b>(2) Use of Types</b>
<p>
<DD>
   To use types, each distinct class of numbers would have a different
   type, with  a precision  appropriate to  the task  being performed.
   Security  is  better  than  with  the  use  of  subtypes,  but  all
   conversions must  be explicit.  On the  other hand,  converting the
   program for use on another target computer is simple and efficient.
   This is  because each  type is mapped separately using only as much
   precision as  necessary. Of course, the efficiency is also high for
   the  initial   application  computer   as  well,   since   even   a
   nonoptimizing compiler  will map  each type  onto  the  appropriate
   hardware type.
</DL>
<p>

Both cases above assume that the programs have been written well using
named types or subtypes. Direct use of FLOAT and LONG_FLOAT is absent,
so that  no assumption  has been  made about  the precisions  of these
types. For  a discussion of the construction of mathematical libraries
in Ada,  and of  how one  can parameterize  with respect  to different
precisions, see <a href="ratl-BIB.html">[SWKW]</a>.

<H3><BR><a name="5.3.2">5.3.2 Fixed Point Types</a></H3>
<p>

The definition of the fixed point types is more difficult, for several
reasons. First, the representation cannot be determined until both the
range and  delta are  known. These  two parameters determine the width
required in  bits and  the position  of the  decimal  (binary)  point.
Having  determined   these,  the   representation  is  fixed  and  the
operations can  be defined.  The  second  problem  is  that  the  type
resulting from  multiplication and  division is universal_fixed. Since
no operations  are available on the type universal_fixed, a product or
a quotient  must be  explicitly converted  to the  required  type  (or
subtype).
<p>
In a  fixed point type declaration, the value following delta, and the
two range  bounds (which  must be  provided) are  of any real type but
must have  a value determined at compilation time, that is, given by a
static expression.  In a subtype declaration, the delta value must not
be less than that of the type, and the range constraint values must be
within the values of the type.
<p>
To illustrate  the representation  of fixed point values, consider for
example the type declaration
<p>
<PRE>    type F is delta 0.01 range -100.0 .. 100.0;</PRE>
<p>
We assume  the target machine to be a 16-bit minicomputer using two's-
complement arithmetic.  Assuming that  no length clause has been given
for F'SMALL,  the implemented  range would  use the  next power of two
above 100  to encompass  the stated range, and would be (-128 .. 127),
which needs  7 bits  of magnitude  (and 1  sign bit) above the decimal
point. Similarly  7 bits  are required below the decimal point to give
error bound  &lt; 0.01. Hence 15 bits are required (sign, 7 above decimal
point, 7  below decimal  point),  leaving  one  spare  bit  which  can
conveniently be  at the  bottom of  the word to provide a (fortuitous)
guard bit (that is, precision beyond what is needed).
<p>
This representation  is clearly  the most efficient in terms of space,
since F'SMALL  is a power of 2. A different representation is obtained
by specifying  an arbitrary  real number  S for  F'SMALL in  a  length
clause
<p>
<PRE>    for F'SMALL use S;</PRE>
<p>
In this case each value of the type is an exact integer multiple of S,
and the  predefined attribute  F'SIZE will  tell how  many bits are in
fact used to store it. S must not exceed F'DELTA.
<p>
The predefined  attribute R'DELTA  for a fixed point type or subtype R
has a value of type universal_real which is that given in the accuracy
constraint of the type or subtype.
<p>
Given two  fixed point  types F  and G (and using I to denote INTEGER)
then we have the following operations:
<p>

</td></tr></table></center>
<p>
Fixed point  operators =  and /=  are permitted for the same reason as
for floating point.
<p>
Defining the  semantics of  these operations in terms of the permitted
rounding error  requires care.  The  basic  source  of  error  is  the
representation of  constants and  intermediate results.  If EPSILON is
half the  delta of F (that is, EPSILON = F'DELTA/2), then a constant C
is represented by a machine value C1 such that
<p>
<PRE>    C - EPSILON  &lt;  C1  &lt;  C + EPSILON</PRE>
<p>
The operations  above that  yield a result type universal_fixed obey a
similar inequality:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
X, Y :  F;

X&#42;Y  - EPSILON  &lt;  F(X&#42;Y)   &lt;  X&#42;Y   + EPSILON
X/Y  - EPSILON  &lt;  F(X/Y)   &lt;  X/Y   + EPSILON
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
where the  upper and  lower limits  are calculated mathematically (and
the result  is assumed  to lie  within the  range of  F). A value C is
representable without  error if  C1 = C. Computations with such values
are exact,  except for  division and  fixed point multiplication. Note
that integer  multiplication is  essentially repeated addition, it can
overflow  but   cannot  lose   accuracy.  Note   also   that   integer
multiplication by  a floating point value is not permitted, since this
is not  equivalent to  repeated addition.  In this  case  the  integer
operand must  be  explicitly  floated.  The  user  could  define  this
operation if required.
<p>
The operations of fixed multiplication and division are essentially in
two parts. First, the accurate product or quotient is formed (that is,
a result  of the type universal_fixed is obtained). Second, the result
must be  converted before being assigned to any variable or being used
in further  computation. This  conversion may imply a loss of accuracy
due to  the representation  in the  destination type:  since the fixed
point operands  are essentially  just scaled  integers,  the  accurate
product will  in fact  be another  scaled integer,  but  the  accurate
quotient must  be treated  as a  ratio of  integers. The  operation of
fixed division  by an  integer operates  in an  analogous way  and  is
merely provided  to avoid  excessive explicit type conversions. A real
literal is  not allowed  as an  operand  of  fixed  multiplication  or
division, since  there is  not a  unique fixed  point type to which to
convert it;  this situation can be resolved by an explicit conversion,
or better,  by using  a declared  constant -  which simplifies program
maintenance.
<p>
To understand  the computational  aspects it is simplest to consider a
decimal machine  and model.  Take a  word as  being a  sign and  three
digits (SDDD), and consider the following declaration
<p>
<PRE>    type NORMAL is delta 0.001 range -0.999 .. 0.999;</PRE>
<p>
This type requires all of the word with the representation S.DDD (that
is, the point next to the far left of the word). Consider also
<p>
<PRE>    type LARGE is delta 10.0 range -800.0 .. 800.0;</PRE>
<p>
This would ordinarily be implemented as (SDDD.), with one guard digit.
Finally, consider
<p>
<PRE>    type MEDIUM is delta 0.1 range -9.0 .. 9.0;</PRE>
<p>
This would  have the  representation (SD.DD)  with one guard digit. We
can illustrate the use of these types as follows
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
X     :  NORMAL;
L1, L2 :  LARGE;
C :  constant MEDIUM :=  2.3;

X :=  0.3333;         -- last digit lost on conversion to NORMAL
                      -- Now |X - 0.3333| &lt; NORMAL'DELTA,
                      -- (mathematically)

X :=  X + 0.1;        -- 0.1 needs no qualification as the left
operand
                      -- specifies the type (NORMAL) of 0.1

X :=  2&#42;X;            -- Now X = 0.866

X :=  X/2;            -- equivalent to X := NORMAL(X/2.0), that is,
                      -- integer division avoids qualification

X :=  NORMAL(C&#42;X);    -- the constant is represented as 2.30
                      -- The machine evaluates
                      -- 2.30&#42;0.433 = 0.99590 (six-digit answer)
and then
                      -- rounds the result to 0.996, which is
stored in X.
                      -- Note that rounding is needed (no guard
digit for
                      -- NORMAL).

L1 :=  700.0;         -- the .0 is necessary: no implicit
conversion
                      -- of an integer literal to a fixed point
type

L1 :=  LARGE(X&#42;L1);   -- calculates 700.0&#42;0.996 = 697.20, rounds to
697.0
                      -- (assuming the guard digit for LARGE)

...

L1 :=  LARGE(X&#42;L1) + L1;   -- conversion is necessary, and serves
                      -- to emphasize rounding before addition

L2 :=  LARGE(X&#42;L1) + 100.0;     -- conversion is necessary

if L1 &gt; X then        -- not legal: L1 and X must have the same
type

if L1 &gt; LARGE(L2 &#42; X) then -- legal: explicit conversion
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The user can perform accurate computation with fixed point by ensuring
that only  exactly representable  values are  used. In  fact, the only
source of  error is  the implied  rounding of constants and conversion
(which is necessary for multiplication and division).
<p>
<H4>Example:</H4>
<p>
A frequent calculation in some numerical applications is the smoothing
of an input sequence by means of a running average:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
OLD_VAL, NEW_VAL :  F;
...
OLD_VAL :=  0.9 &#42; OLD_VAL   +   0.1 &#42; NEW_VAL;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
To program  this in  Ada using  fixed point, the types of the products
and constants on the right hand side must be specified, that is:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
K1 :  constant FRACTION :=  0.9;
K2 :  constant FRACTION :=  0.1;

OLD_VAL :=  F(K1 &#42; OLD_VAL) + F(K2 &#42; NEW_VAL);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
An error  analysis reveals  that a small error in the constant K1 will
cause a much larger error in OLD_VAL after successive iterations (thus
a constant value of 10.0 as input converges to 9.09 if 0.9 is replaced
by 0.89 for K1). This increase in error occurs when the sum of the two
constants is not exactly 1.0. To avoid this cumulative effect, one can
omit the larger constant and write the following:
<p>
<PRE>    OLD_VAL :=  OLD_VAL + F(K2 &#42; (NEW_VAL - OLD_VAL));</PRE>
<p>
<H4>Example:</H4>
<p>
As another  illustration of  the use  of  fixed  point,  consider  the
following  function   for  computing   the  average  of  an  array  of
components:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
type F is   ...                -- some fixed point type
type INDEX is range 1 .. 100;
type FIXED_VECTOR is array (INDEX) of F;

function AVERAGE(A :  FIXED_VECTOR) return F is
  NUM_ITEMS :  constant INTEGER :=  INDEX'LAST;
  type SUMF is delta F'DELTA
    range NUM_ITEMS&#42;F'FIRST  ..  NUM_ITEMS&#42;F'LAST;
  SUM :  SUMF :=  0.0;
begin
  for I in A'RANGE loop
    SUM :=  SUM + SUMF(A(I));
  end loop;
  return F(SUM/NUM_ITEMS);
end;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Here, the  type SUMF  has a  greater range  than F  to accommodate the
larger potential  range of  values. The explicit conversion inside the
loop does  not lose  accuracy, but the final division potentially will
lose accuracy.  If type  F requires  nearly a full word, then the type
SUMF will be double length. It is very difficult to write an algorithm
to obtain  the average  which avoids  double length. Since the size of
the array  is involved  in the  type SUMF,  this size must be known at
compilation time.

<H3><BR><a name="5.3.3">5.3.3 A Semantic Model for Approximate Computation</a></H3>
<p>

Programming languages  do not  conventionally define  the semantics of
floating  point   arithmetic.  However,   in  Ada,  with  declarations
controlling the  accuracy of  data types, it is highly desirable to do
so. A  proposal of W. S. Brown <a href="ratl-BIB.html">[Br 78]</a> makes it possible to describe a
model which  is both  clean in  structure and  realistic (that  is, it
describes the  actual behavior of floating point arithmetic units). In
this section,  a brief overview is given of the model as needed by the
language.
<p>
For each  type, an  abstract representation  is defined.  The abstract
representation of  each nonzero  number x  takes the form of a sign, a
mantissa, and  an integer exponent. Thus for the binary representation
we have
<p>
<PRE>    x =  þ m &#42; 2&#42;&#42;n</PRE>
<p>
where
<p>
<PRE>    1/2  &lt;  m  &lt;  1</PRE>
<p>
that is,  the number  is normalized: the most significant binary digit
is always 1. For example, a mantissa of length 3 allows representation
of only  the following  mantissa values  (using the notation for based
literals):
<p>
<PRE>    2#0.100#,  2#0.101#,  2#0.110#,  2#0.111#</PRE>
<p>
The relative  precision here varies from 1 in 4 to 1 in 7; in general,
mantissa length B guarantees precision of only 1 in 2&#42;&#42;(B-1), although
near to  1 the  precision is  nearly 1  in 2&#42;&#42;B.  Hence to guarantee D
decimal digits  precision requires  B to  be one  more than  the least
integer greater than D&#42;log(10)/log(2). If for example we declare
<p>
<PRE>    type F is digits 6;</PRE>
<p>
then the  mantissa will  have 21  binary digits, that is, F'MANTISSA =
21. If the smallest value of the exponent is -84 and the largest is 84
(the values required by Ada in this case - see below) then
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
F'SMALL  = 2#0.1#e-84
F'LARGE  = 2#0.11111_11111_11111_11111_1#e84.
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
We do  not assume that numbers are represented in this fashion, merely
that numbers  having the  numeric values given above are representable
in the  machine. Brown  now  develops  axioms  for  the  representable
numbers and  the behavior  of a  machine number  that is bounded by an
interval whose endpoints are representable numbers. These axioms allow
the use  of higher  precision than specified in the declaration, which
is essential in Ada, since the implemented precision will typically be
greater than the declared precision.
<p>
The Ada  version of  the Brown  model  for  floating  point  works  as
follows:
<ol>
<li>From the  decimal precision  specified (F'DIGITS) the
   corresponding  number   of  binary   places  is  determined,  being
   F'MANTISSA.
<p>
<li>The model  numbers are  those with  F'MANTISSA binary
   places and an exponent in the range
<p>
<PRE>    -4&#42;F'MANTISSA .. 4&#42;F'MANTISSA.</PRE>
<p>
<li>The safe  numbers are  those with  F'MANTISSA  binary
   places and  a potentially  larger exponent  range  limited  by  the
   hardware.
</ol>

The model numbers guarantee workable properties including a reasonable
range of  values -  their definition is machine-independent: hence the
term model.  The safe numbers allow one to exploit the larger exponent
range  that   many  machines  provide.  Safe  numbers  have  the  same
properties as  model numbers  and include  the model numbers but their
range is machine-dependent.
<p>
For fixed  point types,  a similar representation is chosen without an
exponent. In  this case  for the binary representation of each nonzero
number x we use:
<p>
<PRE>    x =  þ M &#42; small</PRE>
<p>
where M  is now  an integer,  whose length  B defines  its range  1 ..
2&#42;&#42;(B-1), and  small is  the  smallest  positive  representable  value
(corresponding to M=1). Axioms (not treated by Brown) can now be given
which reflect  the exact nature of some operations and the approximate
nature of  others. In  addition, because of the obvious correspondence
between  the   abstract  representations  of  all  approximate  types,
conversions can be defined.
<p>
These conversions  and some use of subtypes can result in weaker error
bounds than those of the type. Consider:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
type F is digits 6;                             -- 21 bits
X :  F;
Y :  F digits 5;                                    -- 18 bits
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The accuracy  constraint in  the declaration  of  Y  implies  loss  of
precision in  the subtype.  Thus the  statement  Y  :=  X;  allows  an
implementation to  lose the  three least  significant binary digits on
the assignment.  A subsequent  assignment X  := Y; will then mean that
the last  three bits  of X  are undefined  (that is, the interval that
bounds the value of X is larger than that given by the type).
<p>
<H4>Example:</H4>
<p>
Consider the fixed point type:
<p>
<PRE>    type F is delta 0.01 range -100.0 .. 100.0;</PRE>
<p>
To discuss  the semantics, we again write model numbers in the form of
based numbers, thus:
<p>
<PRE>    64 = 2#100_0000.0000_000#</PRE>
<p>
Then
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
F'FIRST     = -2#110_0100.0000_000#        = -100.0
F'LAST      = 2#110_0100.0000_000#         = 100.0
F'MANTISSA  = 14
F'SMALL     = 1/128 = 2#000_0000.0000_001# = 0.0078125(&lt;0.01)
F'LARGE     = 255 + 127/128 = 2#111_1111.1111_111#  = 255.9921875
-- F'DELTA is not a model number
-- F'FIRST and F'LAST are model numbers in this
-- example but this need not always be the case.
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Now consider the representation of 2.1, as in the declaration:
<p>
<PRE>    Z :  F :=  2.1;</PRE>
<p>
The value is bounded by the two consecutive model numbers
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
2 + 12/128 = 2#000_0010.0001_100# = 2.09375
2 + 13/128 = 2#000_0010.0001_101# = 2.1015625
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
of the type F, which therefore define the smallest model interval that
bounds Z.  On a  20-bit machine,  Z is likely to be represented by the
machine value (using the same notation) of
<p>
<PRE>    2.10009765625 = 8602/4096 = 2#000_0010.0001_1001_1010#</PRE>
<p>
The error analysis of ordinary computation proceeds similarly. Take:
<p>
<PRE>    Z :=  Z + 2.0;</PRE>
<p>
Here 2.0 is a model number (and hence is represented exactly). So as a
result, the  bounds for  Z are  now  4.09375  and  4.1015625.  If  the
operands are  not model numbers, then the bounds for the result of the
operation  are   computed  as  the  closest  model  numbers  that  are
guaranteed to enclose all possible results, for all possible values in
the model intervals associated with the operands. Thus after
<p>
<PRE>    Z :=  Z + Z;</PRE>
<p>
we shall  get new  bounds 8.1875  and 8.203125  for Z,  so  the  model
interval associated with Z has doubled in size.
<p>
The logic  with fixed  point multiplication  and division  is slightly
different. Take
<p>
<PRE>    Z :=  F(X &#42; Y);</PRE>
<p>
Here X and Y are of any fixed point types, not necessarily type F, but
of  course  Z  must  be  of  type  F  for  the  rules  for  assignment
compatibility.  The   logic  of  multiplication  (and  similarly  with
division) is as follows. X and Y are computed in the ordinary way, and
associated with  each of their values will be a corresponding bounding
model interval.  The multiplication is then performed with essentially
arbitrarily high precision. One can think of this intuitively in terms
of giving  a double length result. This arbitrarily accurate result is
then converted  to type  F; in  consequence some  accuracy may well be
lost, and in any case a bounding model interval will be dependent upon
the characteristics  of the  fixed point  type F.  This result is then
assigned, of course, to the variable Z in this case.
<p>
The reason  why multiplication  and division  work  in  this  way,  is
because the  resulting values  cannot be constrained to lie within the
same range  and delta  as of  the type  of the  operands. Hence  it is
essential that  these operations allow the result to be rescaled. This
is done  in two  stages: by  calculating a  result with an essentially
arbitrarily high precision, and then by explicit conversion to a fixed
point type.
